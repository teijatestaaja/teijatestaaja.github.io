## Introduction

<img src="assets/images/me.png" alt="Photo of me" hspace="20" width="30%" align="right"/> I am Teija Alasalmi, Test Automation Engineer and Portuguese major student at the University of Helsinki. I hold two Master's degrees in Computer Science and English, and a Bachelor's degree in Business Information Technology (Front End Programming). 

My passions include anything related to test automation as well as Spanish or Portuguese language. I play rugby as a hobby and train karate for becoming a black belt someday.
